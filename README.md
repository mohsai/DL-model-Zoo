# DL-model-Zoo

In this repository different deep learning models will be implemented. The 'cat and dog' dataset from kaggle will be used with
all models. The focus is not on model performance but developing different working models which can be later optimized.

Following is the list of the implemented models:

1. 

2. Transfer Learning-ResNet-50: Transfer learning concept is used to classify the cat&dog datset with ResNet-50. Pre.trained weights are used for all layers except top most layer.
